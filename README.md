# Vortex: AI-Powered Application Builder

Vortex is an advanced, AI-powered application builder that allows you to turn ideas into functional web applications. Describe your app concept, attach media for inspiration, and Vortex will generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. You can then iteratively refine your creation using chat-like instructions.

This project was generated by Vortex itself and is ready for public deployment.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI Code Generation:** Generate entire web applications, components, animations, and more from a text prompt.
-   **Multi-Provider Support:** Seamlessly switch between AI models from Google (Gemini), OpenAI, Anthropic, and more.
-   **Iterative Development:** Modify and enhance your generated code with natural language instructions.
-   **Visual & Media Input:** Use images, videos, or even other websites as inspiration for the AI.
-   **Project Management:** Save, load, delete, and even mix projects to create new, fused applications.
-   **Live Preview & Code Editing:** See your app come to life in a live preview and make manual code edits in a built-in editor.
-   **Theming:** Switch between a modern "Pixel" theme and a retro "Terminal" theme.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is a static web app and can be deployed to any modern static hosting provider like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

### General Steps

1.  Push the project files (including this `README.md`) to a Git repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab).
2.  Connect your Git repository to your chosen hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
3.  Configure the build settings. Since this project requires no build step, you can typically leave these settings at their default or specify that no build command is needed. The publish directory is the root of the project.
4.  **Set the Environment Variable.** This is the most important step.
5.  Deploy!

### üîë Environment Variable for Gemini

To enable the Google Gemini features, you **MUST** configure an environment variable in your hosting provider's project settings:

-   **Variable Name:** `API_KEY`
-   **Variable Value:** Your Google AI Studio API Key.

Without this environment variable, all functionality relying on the Gemini API will fail.

### Other AI Provider Keys

API keys for other providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc.) are configured within the application's UI. They are stored securely in the user's local browser storage (`localStorage`) and are not required at deployment time.

## üìÅ Project Structure

-   `index.html`: The main entry point of the application.
-   `index.tsx`: The root of the React application.
-   `App.tsx`: The main React component that manages state and views.
-   `components/`: Contains all the React components for different parts of the UI.
-   `services/`: Handles API calls to the different AI providers.
-   `types.ts`: Defines all the TypeScript types used throughout the application.
